# 🖥️ My-Processor

This project is a class assignment at ENSIIE in the **"Hardware Architecture"** course.

🚀 **Goal**: Create a custom processor using Diglog.  
Aside from division and multiplication (from the last exercise), all other functionalities are implemented.  

🛠️ Assembly code was written to test the processor and can be found in the folder: `test`.

📁 The processor is located in the folder: `digproc`.  

To open the project, install Diglog and use the following command:  
```bash
diglog digproc/*.lgf
```

⚠️ Disclaimer
The folder digcomp contains files for translating assembly code to binary code. These were provided by the course instructor and were not written by me.
